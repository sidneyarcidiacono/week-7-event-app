# Week 5:

## REST APIs

We've made calls to external APIs, now it's time to build your own and make our app much more responsive!

Follow the TODOs in [assignments](https://github.com/flask-django-independent-study/rookie/blob/master/Assignments/Week-5-REST-APIs.md)!

Don't forget to check out the stretch challenges for extra practice!
